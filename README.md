# Assignment-1
Idea: a local company whose product is a student database system software for schools to use to manage their students’ data. The website is to showcase their product to potential customers and gain new customers by purchasing from their website. The homepage tries to get the reader’s attention and lead them to view the features or the prices. The Features page lists down all the features of the product accompanied with images to retain their attention and potentially persuade them to purchase the product. The Pricings page allows users to view the available plans or upgrade their existing plan based on their needs or redeem codes to gain a discount. At the top of each page, there is a navigation bar for easy navigation between pages, and a footer containing the contact details of the company at the bottom of each page.

## Design Process
- As a school administrator, I want to view the features of the database, so I can make a decision to buy the product.
- As a school administrator, I want to compare different plans, so I can choose the right one for my school.
- As a school administrator, I want to contact the company for more information about the product, so I can clarify doubts.

I went for a minimalist / modern startup website selling a digital product. This website is mainly for school administrators to look for a low-cost student database for their schools to store student data. My website is very easy to navigate, and all the relevant information is easy to find.
