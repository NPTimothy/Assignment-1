Idea: a local company whose product is a student database system software for schools to use to manage their students’ data. The website is to showcase their product to potential customers and gain new customers by purchasing from their website. The homepage tries to get the reader’s attention and lead them to view the features or the prices. The Features page lists down all the features of the product accompanied with images to retain their attention and potentially persuade them to purchase the product. The Pricings page allows users to view the available plans or upgrade their existing plan based on their needs or redeem codes to gain a discount. At the top of each page, there is a navigation bar for easy navigation between pages, and a footer containing the contact details of the company at the bottom of each page.
